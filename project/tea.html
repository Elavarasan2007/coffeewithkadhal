        <p style="text-align: right;">A coffee shop is a welcoming place that offers a cozy environment for people to enjoy their favorite coffee drinks and snacks.<br> The space is usually filled with the rich scent of fresh coffee, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.<br> Comfortable seating, whether plush chairs or simple wooden tables, makes it a great spot to relax, study, or work. <br>Soft music often plays in the background, enhancing the relaxed vibe,<br> while the gentle sounds of coffee machines and quiet conversations fill the room.<br> Many coffee shops have a unique, personal style—some are rustic and simple,<br> others modern and artistic, making each shop a special place for people to unwind, socialize, and<br> savor a moment of calm in their day.</p>
